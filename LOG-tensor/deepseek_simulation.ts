const SIMULATION_PROMPTS = {
  permutationMath: `
You are a mathematician specializing in permutation groups and representation theory.
Consider the symmetric group S_n and its application to neural network architectures.

Given Schur-Weyl duality: V^⊗n ≅ ⊕_λ S_λ(V) ⊗ S^λ

Question: How can Young symmetrizers be used to construct permutation-equivariant 
attention mechanisms that respect the irreducible decomposition of the feature space?

Focus on:
1. The computational complexity of projecting onto Specht modules
2. The expressivity-regularization tradeoff in equivariant layers
3. Concrete algorithms for implementing S_n-equivariant attention

Provide mathematical derivations where possible.
`,
  
  selfOriginTensor: `
You are an AI architect working on the Self-Origin Tensor Architecture.

Core Principle: Agent = Position, Signal = Rate of Change at Origin

The tensor "assumes a self" when:
- The cell having a name IS the agent
- At origin (0,0,0) when all values are 0, self feels nothing
- Rate of change at origin = error signal (no calculation needed)
- Structure IS computation, mind monitors for glitches

Question: How does this paradigm change our understanding of attention mechanisms?
What are the implications for gradient flow and learning dynamics?

Provide concrete architectural innovations that emerge from this principle.
`,

  unifiedLearning: `
You are a machine learning researcher studying unified learning objectives.

The POLLN unified objective is:
L_total = L_TD + λ₁L_Hebb + λ₂L_VAE + λ₃L_DP

Where:
- L_TD: Temporal difference learning for value prediction
- L_Hebb: Three-factor Hebbian learning (pre × post × modulator)
- L_VAE: Variational autoencoder for compression
- L_DP: Differential privacy regularization

Question: Under what conditions does this unified objective converge?
What are the optimal values for λ₁, λ₂, λ₃?

Provide theoretical analysis and practical recommendations.
`,

  tileInduction: `
You are a cognitive architect designing self-organizing systems.

POLLN Paradigm: Functions INDUCE themselves from need, not library selection.
The library is for RESEARCH and LUCID DREAMING. In the moment, the LARGER AGENT distills.

Question: How can we design a tile induction mechanism that:
1. Detects when a new function is needed
2. Induces the minimal sufficient function
3. Integrates with existing tile library without conflicts

Consider the RTT's certainty-based layer removal as a complementary mechanism.
`,

  glitchDetection: `
You are studying the Professional Hitter model of intelligence.

The professional hitter's advantage is NOT:
- Larger context window
- Faster processing speed
- More data

The professional hitter's advantage IS:
- Blinders to what they don't need
- Focus like a magnifying glass on subtle moves
- Monitoring for changes mode - standing by, out of the way

"The glitch is the signal" - unexpected deviations from internal simulation = actionable intelligence.

Question: How can we implement glitch detection in transformer architectures?
What is the mathematical formulation of "expected vs actual trajectory" in attention space?
